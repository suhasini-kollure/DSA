/*There are some students, sitting in a circle. Each student is assigned a roll no (1 to n).
There is a teacher who was given an initial roll no and he has to remove the student with initial roll no.
and then has to remove the student who was at that position starting from the removed student.
Your function should return the last student left. Example: 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 start with 3, remove 3,
then remove 5, then remove 1 (follow circle), then remove 4. Ans â€“ 2.*/
